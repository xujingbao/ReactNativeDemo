The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n\t * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n\t * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n\t * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n\t * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n\t * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n\t * invocation.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n\t * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n\t * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n\t *\n\t * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n\t * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n\t *\n\t * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n\t * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n\t *\n\t * @static\n\t * @memberOf _\n\t * @since 0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n\t * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n\t * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n\t * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n\t *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n\t * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n\t *\n\t * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n\t * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n\t *   'leading': true,\n\t *   'trailing': false\n\t * }));\n\t *\n\t * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n\t * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n\t * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n\t * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n\t *\n\t * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n\t */\n\tfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n\t  var lastArgs,\n\t      lastThis,\n\t      maxWait,\n\t      result,\n\t      timerId,\n\t      lastCallTime,\n\t      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n\t      leading = false,\n\t      maxing = false,\n\t      trailing = true;\n\t\n\t  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n\t    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n\t  }\n\t  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n\t  if (isObject(options)) {\n\t    leading = !!options.leading;\n\t    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n\t    maxWait = maxing ?

The data in the\n\t * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.

We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n\t * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n\t * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n\t * it.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * getInitialState: function() {\n\t *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n\t *   return {ds};\n\t * },\n\t * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n\t *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n\t *   this.setState({\n\t *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n\t *   });\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n\t   * headers and rows.

The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n\t * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n\t * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n\t * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n\t * events.\n\t *\n\t * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n\t *\n\t * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n\t * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n\t * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n * whether to re-render it or not.\n *\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.

Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\n// type State = {\n//     isTouching: boolean;\n//     lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number;\n//     lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number;\n//     observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean;\n//     becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean;\n// };\n// type Event = Object;\n\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  // statics: RCTScrollViewConsts,\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.
